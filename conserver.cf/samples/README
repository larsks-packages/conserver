I put together the sample configuration files in this directory in hopes
that it would help folks see some of the possibilities of the
configuration file format.  Each of the files are syntatically correct,
but have never actually been used.

Each file is basically built upon the previous...theoretically, if not
actually.  Hopefully they'll help show some of the cool things you can
do with the configuration file and help those trying to figure out how
they should even start.

    simple.cf - A very simple, one console config file

    basic.cf - A config with a couple consoles, mostly using defaults

    average.cf - A config for many consoles, using breaks, user lists,
		 etc...bascially customizing each area

    average-distributed.cf - Taking average.cf to multiple conserver
			     hosts with overrides on those hosts
