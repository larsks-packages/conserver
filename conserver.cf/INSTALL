The two files you need to set up are the conserver.cf and conserver.passwd
files.  See the sample conserver.cf and conserver.passwd files for examples
(installed in <DATADIR>/examples/conserver).  You can start with those and
then modify extensively.  The man page for conserver.cf and conserver.passwd
should explain the files with enough detail to get you going.

That's about it.  Good luck.
