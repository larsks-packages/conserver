Information from Greg Woods <woods@weird.com>:

    This version of "chat" is derived from the NetBSD variant found in
    /usr/src/usr.sbin/pppd/chat.

    It has had a new '-I' command-line flag added so that it can ignore
    the fact it's not running on a TTY device (i.e. to allow it to work
    over a socket).
