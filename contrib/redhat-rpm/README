    Subject: Red Hat conserver init script for Linux

    Below my sig I've pasted an init script that will start and stop
    conserver on Red Hat Linux. It's set up to work with the chkconfig
    runlevel manager that ships with Red Hat.

    If this spec file goes in the root directory of the distribution as
    conserver.spec, then Red Hat users will be able to build rpms by doing no
    more than

    % rpm -ta conserver-7.x.x.tar.gz

    I'll be happy to do any tweaking necessary to get this to work.
