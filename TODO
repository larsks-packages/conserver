Warning to those who aren't me: this is an unorganized list of things
that might be classified as bugs, improvements, random thoughts or
suggestions.  Hopefully it will get cleaned up over time (yeah,
right!).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Telnet protocol should be improved
    - Not even RFC 854 compliant...or maybe it is (as of 8.1.0)
    - Option negotiation semi-ignored - should we negotiate anything more?
    - Others?

- syslog?
    Daniel E. Singer <des@cs.duke.edu> would like to see it - especially
    in regards to --use-libwrap code

- alternate (md5) password encryption support in conserver.passwd
    - actually happens if the crypt() call supports it, like under linux
    - hpux has bigcrypt() also, which we support, so maybe we're covered

- config file examples for various configurations
    - sample conserver.cf has some...but it's not explained well

- per-line timestamps
    - only when not connected?

- pipe input/output (console <-> program) via 'console'
    - some apps (net-ups thing, gdb) might need to talk to user
    - ^Ec| does this, but the interact with user bits might not work
    - actually, ^Ec| does work right with 8.1.0...one change that might
      be nice is the ability to NOT watch the i/o pass to the local
      command - try sending a big file to the local host with xmodem.

- autologout?  setting per console?  gack, would have to interpret data.
    - this will never happen...i don't want to interpret data

- "listen" capability (watch all/multiple consoles)

- send data to multiple consoles (carbon copy) -
    Steve Lammert <slammert@panasas.com>

- authentication to terminal servers (ssh, passphrase, whatever)
    - ssh should probably just be handled by invoking the ssh command.
      so, that's really already covered, no?
    - passphrase...hmmm..could really use some sort of send/expect
      thing here.  you could write a wrapper script of sorts, but it
      really would be nice to have a raw socket and do the right thing.
    - this does work, using the 'initcmd' option, so, all done?

- cyclades ts1000/2000 port : "Moses, Joel" <jmoses@deloitte.com>

- strftime() idea for logfile names : Lars Kellogg-Stedman <lars@larsshack.org>

- 9600baud log replay?

- server -M flag should accept multiple addresses (comma separated)
    - should client as well?
    - this may never happen...does anyone really need it?

- automatic log rotation in general : Egan Ford <egan@us.ibm.com>

- website docs on serial port configs
    - PCs (solaris x86, linux, *bsd, etc)
    - lilo
    - bios support

- suggestions by Trevor Fiatal <trevor@seven.com>
    - include server hostname on 'console -x' output
	- i think the -i output covers it, but maybe not

- ability to configure strings to be sent to a console periodically :
  Greg A. Woods <woods@planix.com>

- show attach/detach events to/of spy console clients : Greg A. Woods
  <woods@planix.com>

- redefine client escape sequence in conserver.cf : Toby Gerhart
  <toby.gerhart@eds.com>
    - not even sure if this is possible w/o confusing the client,
      but maybe with the new 8.1.0 client-server protocol, we can!

- log rotation by date : Tom Pachla <tom.pachla@nlc-bnc.ca>

- strict file permission checks on conserver.passwd/conserver.cf : Erik
  Sjolund <erik.sjolund@sbc.su.se>

- netgroup support?  : Nikolaos Papavassiliou
  <Nikolaos.Papavassiliou@reuters.com> and Phil Dibowitz <phil@usc.edu>

- send sequences to console on client connect? (to repaint screen,
  for example) : John Cagle <jcagle@gmail.com>

- uucp locks : Sebastian Zagrodzki <sebek@heron.net.icm.edu.pl>

- support more than 9 break sequences : Danish Mirza <Danish@lehman.com>
  thought it was easy, but adding more than could break things with
  current encoding.  doable, will have to think harder about it.

- reintroduce console grouping : Martin Turba
  <martin.turba@igd.fraunhofer.de>

- quick-recheck of down consoles (for uds) and possibly only log state
  changes (instead of each try) : DJ Gregor <dj@gregor.com>
