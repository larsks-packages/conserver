To install this program you need root access and access to the physical
console of the machine (either through the console server or via the physical
world).

First compile this program and install it as /etc/autologin or
/usr/local/etc/autologin.  If `/' is the only file system mounted sometimes
you'll have to use the /etc directory.

OK.  Then login on the console as root and run
	# exec /etc/autologin -l root

if you get a prompt back with no warnings things look good.  Next try
to force *your* account on the console (replace `ME' with your account):
	# finger -s
	...
	# exec /etc/autologin -l ME
	$ finger -s
	...

You should have seen root on the console the first time you ran finger and
`ME' on the console the second.

If you got this far we are ready to make the leap.  Exit the autologin shell
as `ME' and login as root *on another terminal*.  Edit /etc/inittab on a
System V machine

	cons2:2:respawn:/usr/local/etc/autologin -t/dev/tty0 -lroot >/dev/console 2>&1
or
	co:2:respawn:/usr/local/etc/autologin -t/dev/console -lroot


or on an RIOS run commands like:
	mkitab "cons0:013456789:respawn:/etc/getty /dev/console"
	mkitab "cons2:2:respawn:/usr/local/etc/autologin -t/dev/tty0 -lroot -gsystem >/dev/console 2>&1"
	chitab "cons:0123456789:off:/etc/getty /dev/console"
	chcons -a login=disable


if you are running SunOS edit /etc/ttytab and comment out the line for the
console and add a new one for autologin:
	#console        "/usr/etc/getty cons8"          unknown on local
	console "/usr/local/etc/autologin -lroot -t"    xterm   on local secure

In either case restart init on the port now
	kill -1 1
or
	telinit 2
or what ever local custom sez.

One of these will look right to you.


You should get a root shell on the console that you can exit and it will just
come back.  When the machine reboots it should stick the same shell up.  You
can make the login name here be `ops' or some other `operator' account to run
backups.  We use `root'.
