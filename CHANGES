          <cote2004-github@yahoo.com>

        - removal of old RCS/CVS tags since we have git

version 8.2.1 (Jun 2, 2015):
        - added TCP keepalives between client and server - TCP-based consoles
          already had the code - this was mostly an oversight
        - patch for SEGV and task execution - patch by Artem Savkov
          <asavkov@redhat.com>
        - expanded break sequences from [1-9] to [1-9a-z] - based on patch by
          Artem Savkov <asavkov@redhat.com>

version 8.2.0 (Apr 20, 2014):
        - added --with-trust-uds-cred which uses getsockopt() to fetch and
          trust the client uid, bypassing password lookups - patch by Anton

        - missing closedir() causing memory leak - patch by Anton Lundin
          <glance@acc.umu.se>
        - sending a break signal over IPMI was broken - based on patch by
          Alexander Y.  Fomichev <git.user@gmail.com>
        - IPv6 support (marked as experimental at this point because it's
          untested (except by the author), there's a lack of documentation, and
          I'm hoping for non-getifaddrs() system support) - patch by Milos
          Vyletel <milos.vyletel@gmail.com>
        - no more K&R compiler support

version 8.1.20 (Apr 4, 2014):

          <Karvendhan.M@netapp.com>
        - deprecated --with-cycladests (noop now) - cross-compilation should
          work without it as autologin now expects setpgrp() to take two
          arugments instead of testing for it
        - no automatic checks for an empty password when using PAM
          authentication - based on discussion with Ryan Kirkpatrick
          <linux@rkirkpat.net>

          configuration options - based on patch by Aki Tuomi <cmouse@cmouse.fi>
        - added 'sslcacertificatefile' and 'sslreqclientcert' server
          configuration options
        - added --with-req-server-cert to force clients to require a certificate
          from the server when using SSL - based on emails with Thor Simon
          <tls@coyotepoint.com>
        - added server-side tasks (see conserver.cf man page) that are invoked
          by the client (useful for things like IPMI-based power control of
          servers, invoking resets of terminal server ports, or anything else
          that requires scripting) - ideas from patch by Anton Lundin
          <glance@acc.umu.se> and discussion on mailing list (2011)
        - added 'confirm' option to break sequences
        - added 'breaklist' option to limit exposure of break sequences to

          <Mark.Wedel@sun.com>

          for flexibility and future enhancement

          for broken SSL environents - suggested by Graydon Dodson

          <david+conserver@williamsons.net> years ago  ;-)
        - touched up Makefiles to test against .h files

          cause the login sequence to fail and you can never attach to
          the console

          consoles managed by the host
        - added 'initcmd' console option which allows a command to

          conserver.cf and conserver.passwd files in
          $(prefix)/share/examples/conserver - suggested by
          Hubert Feyrer <hubertf@netbsd.org>

version 8.0.0-beta4 (Aug 24, 2003):

          connections to occur first, protecting *all* information
        - added 'admin' keyword to the 'access' portion of the config
          file for specifying users able to issue the 'quit' command
        - removed client -G option since it's not really useful any more
        - added client -t option for sending "text messages" to users,
          which is similar to broadcast messages, but you can specify
          the user and/or console - suggested by Trevor Fiatal
          <trevor@seven.com>
        - added client -d option for disconnecting users specified by
          username and/or console - suggested by Trevor Fiatal

          be specified in the config file (default 250ms)
        - removed 'reset -x' portion of default break sequence #3
        - remote conserver hostnames now properly match - had to be a
          character string match previously
        - hostname aliases now checked against access lists and the
          matched name is used for logging
        - added --with-trustrevdns to enable the use of reverse DNS
          information for access list checks [not recommended] - see the
          INSTALL file for full details on who should actually need this
          Many thanks to Chuck Rouzer <crouzer@yahoo.com> for all the
          help with FreeBSD support and the following issues...

          resolve to 127.0.0.1
        - fixed interface probe problem under *BSD
        - added openpty() interface for pty allocation

        - ***NOTICE*** the format of conserver.cf and conserver.passwd
          has completely changed.  see the INSTALL file for
          upgrade instructions (it should be "fairly painless").
          some documentation has been updated to reflect the new world,
          some hasn't - my goal for beta2 is to have all the docs updated
        - many command-line options now also conserver.cf options options
        - POSIX termios interface now required for compilation - some
          POSIX requirements were already in the code and others will

          Peter Chubb <peter@chubb.wattle.id.au> via Jorgen Hagg
          <jorgen.hagg@axis.com>

          form
        - fixed bad port number in 'cached previous timeout' message -
          reported by Dave Stuit <djs@tellme.com>
        - now using pid_t type for better compatibility
        - fixed the RPM and Solaris package to include the man

          returns both local and remote consoles - suggested by Todd
          Stansell <todd@stansell.org>

          <djs@tellme.com>
        - added SIGUSR2, which does not reread the configuration file,
          but does everything else SIGHUP does - suggested at LISA 2002
        - fixed bug where LOGDIR setting gets used even if no logfile
          is wanted

        - added --with-openssl for some client/server encryption
        - added -E option to client and server to allow for non-encrypted

          for its -l default - suggested by Dave Stuit <djs@tellme.com>
        - putting back socklen_t usage - it's the right thing to do,
          so tell me where it breaks things
        - configure options --with-cffile and --with-pwdfile now
          recognize fully-qualified pathnames - suggested by Kjell
          Andresen <kjell.andresen@usit.uio.no>

version 7.2.3 (Sep 23, 2002):
        - checking for duplicate console names got lost in the major
          7.2.0 rewrite of that code.  it's back now, with a couple of
          other edge-case fixes i noticed while scanning the code -
          reported by Dave Stuit <djs@tellme.com>
        - added --with-pam and PAM authentication support - suggested
          by Stu May <jsmay@wasteofbits.com>
        - added -F server option to prevent automatic reinitialization
          of failed consoles ('|' syntax consoles which exit with a
          zero status are still reinitialized) - requested by William P
          LePera <lepera@us.ibm.com> and Malcolm Gibbs
          <Malcolm.Gibbs005@msd.govt.nz>

        - AC_CHECK_LIB replaced with AC_SEARCH_LIBS in configure.in so
          that irrelevant (and sometimes incompatible) libraries aren't
          linked in

version 7.1.1 (Aug 4, 2001):
        - Now using getlogin() for real username info - suggested by
          Dave Stuit <djs@gnac.com>
        - gethostbyname() failure for a console now doesn't cause a
          shutdown - reported by Todd Stansell <todd@stansell.org>
        - Shutdown via client -q/-Q fixed (broken in 7.1.0 because of
          master process fork() code)
        - Password file parsing fixed to allow for empty passwords -
          allowing users to access conserver without a password prompt
        - Both the password and configuration files no longer have
          line length limitations, they now support comments (`#' lines),
          and lines with leading whitespace are continuations of
          previous lines
        - Client hostname/ip sometimes not printed - reported by Todd
          Stansell <todd@stansell.org>

version 7.1.0 (Jul 26, 2001):
        - Hostname in access list that began with a digit was treated as
          an IP address - only strings using [0-9./] are considered CIDR
          notation and they must be of the form a.b.c.d[/n]
        - Fixed SIGHUP always opening logfile(-L) - shouldn't without -d
        - Fixed 'make install' problem under MacOS X and cygwin
        - Client -l option totally broken in 7.0.3 - patch by Daniel E.
          Singer <des@cs.duke.edu>
        - Client now accepts IP addresses from server and server now sends
          the IP of the socket instead of its hostname to the client,
          fixing part of the multi-interface problem
        - Client no longer passes hostname to server along with username
        - Client now turns off IEXTEN so stuff like ^V passes through
        - Server now pauses one second when reopening a TCP-based console
          to give the terminal server a chance to clean up
        - Master server process now fork()s when accepting clients
        - timestamp-spec can be numeric only ('m' default)
        - Ambiguous console name error now shows ambiguous list
        - Console list in conserver.passwd can now have whitespace
        - Access lists in conserver.cf can now use ',' as a separator
        - Added special '*any*' username in conserver.passwd
        - Username match (real or '*any*') now stops conserver.passwd file
          processing - allowing you to lock out users
        - Added -u flag to server to enable "unloved" output - this is the
          opposite of the old -n flag, which now does nothing
        - Added -7 flag to client and server for stripping the high bit
          of data on either side (--disable-8bit removed)
        - Added -b to server to specify the base port number for the
          secondary communication channel - based on code from Enrik
          Berkhan <Enrik.Berkhan@planb.de>
        - Changed -d and -D flags to -r and -R in client - now -D enables
          debugging mode in the client (and -d is unused)
        - Changed -r to -G in client so -r could be used for the above
        - Client now uses getpassphrase() (if available) for > 8 char
          passwords - pointed out by Gregory Bond <gnb@itga.com.au>
        - Improved signal handling
        - Improved process handling (POSIX waitpid() now necessary)
        - Significant rework of STREAMS-based pseudo-tty code
        - TCP connections ('!' config syntax) now have some Telnet protocol
          knowledge, removing the "noise" seen when connecting to a terminal
          server - reported by Todd Stansell <todd@stansell.org>
        - Various code and message "pretty-printing" done
        - Client and server both run in Windows (tested with Windows
          2000) under the cygwin environment thanks to a debug-fest with
          Emmett Hogan <hogan@gnac.com>
        - Using autoconf version 2.50
        - Man pages reworked and conserver.passwd page created by Dave
          Stuit <djs@gnac.com> - the pain he suffered documenting
          the program (and pointing out many of the bugs fixed above)
          should help endless others

version 7.0.3 (Jul 5, 2001):
        - "Off by 1" bug in 7.0.2 line-oriented timestamp code fixed (extra
          chars in logfile) reported by Matthew Cheek <cheek@mars-systems.com>
        - TODO file added to distribution
        - 'attached', 'detached', and 'bumped' actions now written to
          console logs that have 'a' in timestamp-spec field
        - Default timestamp specification with TIMESTAMP= in .cf file
        - Config file much more forgiving about whitespace in fields
        - gethostbyaddr() failures are no longer fatal
        - Added -M to server to specify the address to listen on
          based on code from Enrik Berkhan <Enrik.Berkhan@planb.de>
        - Added -p option to client and server to specify the port to
          connect to and listen on (--with-port still sets the default)
        - Added logfile output when going into daemon mode
            - Added --with-logfile to configure
            - Added -L to override compile-time logfile location
            - SIGHUP reopens this logfile as well as previous behavior
        - Run as root only restriction removed - warning now (if necessary)
        - More #defines for FreeBSD compatibility
        - Using inet_ntoa() now instead of peeking at bytes
        - Fixed up -V (and -Vv) output for client and server
        - Increased conserver.passwd read buffer (CheckPasswd())
        - Removed DO_VIRTUAL #if's - always build that code now
        - Removed ORIGINAL_CODE #if's (old non-CIDR access list parsing)
        - Changed undocumented -p option to -P in console client
        - man pages updated to reflect a little more reality

version 7.0.2 (Jun 15, 2001):
        - Bogus "ambiguous server abbreviation" with distributed server
          setup fixed
        - Hostname not passed with username from console client
        - Fixed pseudo-terminal ('|' syntax in .cf file) bug with Solaris
          and other STREAMS-based systems (actually works now in 7.X)
        - Line-oriented timestamps in logfiles (see 'l' mark
          specification) based on patch from Benn Oshrin
          <benno@columbia.edu>
        - Generalized debugging output, info messages and error messages
        - Moved library search up in configure.in so function calls are
          detected properly
        - Permissions of install-sh were wrong
        - Trimmed the README file and now distribute conserver.html
        - Redhat RPM bundle (contrib/redhat-rpm) contributed by Paul
          Heinlein <heinlein@measurecast.com>
        - Cleaned up gcc warnings (for Solaris 7, at least)
        - Makefiles now use .c.o: specification instead of %.o:

version 7.0.1 (May 3, 2001):
        - 8bit on by default now (use --disable-8bit for old behavior)
        - FreeBSD patches by Bill Fenner <fenner@research.att.com>
          (hopefully *BSD systems will compile cleaner now)
        - Bad error reporting on getsockopt() found by Bill Fenner
          <fenner@research.att.com>
        - PID file patch by Martin Andrews <mandrews@netgenics.com>

version 7.0.0 (Feb 18, 2001):
        - GNU configure-based packaging!!!
          All work done by Mark D. Roth <roth@feep.net>.
          Thank you!
        - Removed conserver/cons.h and moved options into --with
          and --enable configure arguments
        - ioctl() bug found by Ross Parker <parker@redback.com>
        - Removed last of the "loopback preference" code in
          console/console.c - should have been removed a long time ago

version 6.1.7 (Dec 14, 2000):
        - Documented no parity option in conserver.cf.man
        - Lowered default CONNECTTIMEOUT to 10 seconds
        - Changed more internal references to GNAC
        - Shell command support just plain broken (tracked down and
          slain by Rob Joyce <robjoyce@ee.princeton.edu>)
        - Added a -P option for specifying the password file
        - CPARITY setting reflected in -V output
        - New version numbering scheme and packaging

version 6.16 (Sep 8, 2000):
        - Changed the main GNAC references to Certainty Solutions
        - Made the comment blocks in conserver/cons.h a little less
          confusing
        - There are *NO* code changes to this version.  If you have
          version 6.15, you're good to go.

version 6.15 (Mar 6, 2000):
        - Added debug flag (-D) and the beginning of debug output
        - A timeout can now be set for TCP connect() calls.  The
          default is 30 seconds.  Hosts not responding are only
          tried once at startup (per child), lessening the impact
          of a down terminal server.  See CONNECTTIMEOUT in
          conserver/cons.h.

version 6.14 (Jan 5, 2000):
        - Determining if the local conserver controls a port (with
          @conserver spec) we now compare ip addresses instead of
          hostnames
        - Invalid argument now shows -h output

version 6.13 (Dec 1, 1999):
        - High-bit always stripped from network - now follows
          CPARITY setting in cons.h (found by Daniel Andersson
          <daniel@sto.sema.se>)
        - New conserver -i flag for on-demand connects/disconnects
          to console ports (contributed by Thomas E. Knowles
          <tek@CS.Princeton.EDU>)
        - Solaris, Linux, and others now use tcsendbreak()

version 6.12 (Aug 24, 1999):
        - Blank line bug after '%%' in .cf file (found by Miss
          Himali Patel <cpate03@dcs.bbk.ac.uk>)
     Special thanks to Michael Sullivan <mike@trdlnk.com> for
     the following improvements and fixes...
        - Read result bug in group.c caused lock up
        - Signal handling fixes and cleanup
        - Several minor spelling errors in strings and comments
        - Solaris package creation scripts (contrib/solaris-package)
        - Extended syntax of the access restrictions to understand
          network numbers with optional netmasks

version 6.11 (May 14, 1999):
        - Added broadcast capability in client (-b option)
        - Protected certain escape sequences from end-user use
        - Added "console server shutting down" broadcast
        - Improved local tty break code (thanks Craig and Brian!)

version 6.10 (Jan 26, 1999):
        - Documentation fixes
        - Web page up and running

version 6.09:
        - Added more documentation (look for README and INSTALL files).
        - Fixed up man pages so they are more accurate.

version 6.08:
        - Added support for Linux 2.X and IRIX 6.X
        - Fixed "suspend" code in client - it shouldn't have worked
          before, but slow connections could explain it.

version 6.07:
        - Porting infrastructure has been set up in ./port.  Solaris
          2.5.1 and BSD/OS 3.1 successfully built.
        - Added CHANGES and README files.  Wow, starting to document!

version 6.06:
        - SIGUSR1 now tells the console server to try and reopen all
          currently downed consoles.
        - Cleaned up configuration file (cons.h) and Makefiles.

version 6.05:
        - conserver.cf change: groups and their passwords have been
          removed and timestamp specifications have been added.

before version 6.05:
        - Many, many variations.  Nothing was tracked well.  Bug fixes
          and enhancements of various types were applied.
